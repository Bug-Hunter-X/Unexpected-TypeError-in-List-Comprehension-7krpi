# Unexpected TypeError in Python List Comprehension

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug involving unexpected TypeErrors in a Python list comprehension. The bug occurs when the list comprehension iterates over a list that contains elements of different types, not all dictionaries.

## The Bug

The `bug.py` file contains a function `function_with_uncommon_error` that uses a list comprehension to extract values from a list of dictionaries.  However, if the list contains elements that aren't dictionaries, a `TypeError` will occur. The basic `try...except` block only handles the `KeyError`, and not the `TypeError` that could happen with other kinds of input.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version of the function, which includes more robust error handling to detect and handle cases where input elements are not dictionaries. This addresses the uncommon error by validating the input's type.

## How to reproduce the issue

1. Clone this repo.
2. Navigate to the repository in your terminal.
3. Run `python bug.py`.
